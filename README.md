# LlÃ¡mame Online Website Created with Gatsby

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create site using this project.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the default starter
    npx gatsby new llamame-online https://github.com/moitorrijos/llamame-online-gatsby
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd llamame-online/
    npx gatsby develop
    ```

    or

    ```shell
    cd llamame-online/
    npm run dev
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-default-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

1.  **When finished create a production ready version**

    Create a production ready version of the site by running the following command in the CLI

    ```shell
    npx gatsby build
    ```

    Finally to see the final version run the following command

    ```shell
    npx gatsby serve
    ```

    The site will now be running at `http://localhost:9000` ðŸ”¥

    You can upload the public folder to any web web server. The site is 100% static.
